            Welcome to My Adventures! This is a page where I express my love for travelling and any photos 
        <br>taken at each individual destination. I believe that art can be expressed in several different ways 
        <br>and photography is no exception! 
        <br>
        <br>"Photoraphy may not be considered as one of the traditional seven, but it is included in the broader definition of <br>the visual arts" as expressed by Eden Gallery and as such, I wish to express my very own experience travelling and
        <br>embracing different cultures!
